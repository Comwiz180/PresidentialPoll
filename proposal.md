Final project proposals are due at the end of the class
The group needs to submit a project proposal (1.5-2 pages in IEEE format (see https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preparation-of-papers-for-ieee-sponsored-conferences-and-symposia/zfnqfzzzxghk).
The proposal should provide
    an objective
    a brief motivation for the project,
    detailed discussion of the data that will be obtained or used in the project,
    responsibilities of each member, along with
    a time-line of milestones, and
    the expected outcome
The proposal pdf will be committed to fdac20/ProjectName/proposal.pdf


Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide a visual representation and prediction of how america has shifted demographically
on a political spectrum. An example would be how more liberal people tend to be in the cities while more conservative people tend to be in rural areas. 
The data collected and map created would create something that people could quickly see visually that would show how fast the change has happened and be able to predict
how it might change in the future.
Motivation: We all have some collective interest in politics, it affects all of our lives, from how we vote, to whether we wear a mask, to what we all deem to be rights. 
This would highlight how we have shifted demographically, what we might expect for the future, and how the political demographic will shift further.
Detailed discussion of the data that will be obained: The data will be obtained from various websites that collect polling information from major election years.
The biggest source of information will likely be usa.gov. They collect all information from elections and then publish it online to their website, which we can then take for our own purposes. 
Responsibilities of Team members: Our team will collectively work on pieces together, with some specific roles for each team member to specialize in.
Zachary and Omar will be focusing on data collection for the project, Christian, Justin, and Emory will be focusing on using that data and generating a sort of map that we can
look at for a visual representation. Then Zach and Omar will work on making a prediction for the assignment as well as all the group members expanding our data to include 
senatorial years and years that the house representatives can vote.
timeline of milestones: We will have data collection finished by mid october and the manipulation and visual representations finished by the end of October. From October until
the end of November, we will be working on expanding the program to include more territories and expanding our data from presidential years to every two years.
expected outcome: The expected outcome would be to accurately generate a map visualizing how the country has changed throughout history as well as some other metrics that could 
help predict where the country will go. We expect to complete the project on time and completed in a way so that people could learn something about how our country has been
polarizing and shifting in demographics.
