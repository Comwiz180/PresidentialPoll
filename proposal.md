The group needs to submit a project proposal (1.5-2 pages in IEEE format (see https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/preparation-of-papers-for-ieee-sponsored-conferences-and-symposia/zfnqfzzzxghk).
The proposal should provide

    a brief motivation for the project,
    detailed discussion of the data that will be obtained or used in the project,
    responsibilities of each member, along with
    a time-line of milestones, and
